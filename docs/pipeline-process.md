# CI/CD Pipeline

- The CircleCi account is linked to the udagram project on the Github account.
- After the application code in the deployment script succeeds on CircleCI, the updates will automatically be deploy to AWS.
- The pipeline is triggered to automatically execute once a commit is pushed successfully to the remote repo main branch.
